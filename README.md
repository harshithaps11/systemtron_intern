# Python & AI/ML Projects at System Tron

This repository contains a collection of projects I developed during my internship at **System Tron**, where I worked on **Python** and **AI/ML** projects. These projects include a variety of applications ranging from machine learning models for disease detection to fun games and utilities.

## Projects Overview

### 1. IPL Match Winner Predictor
This project uses historical data of IPL matches to predict the winner of upcoming matches. The model is trained using machine learning algorithms and factors such as team performance, weather conditions, player statistics, and match history.

#### Features:
- Train a model using IPL match data.
- Predict match outcomes based on statistical features.
- Evaluate model performance with accuracy metrics.

### 2. Breast Cancer Detection
This project implements a machine learning model to detect breast cancer using data from a popular dataset like the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**. The goal is to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on features extracted from medical imaging.

#### Features:
- Train a classifier using the breast cancer dataset.
- Classify new data as malignant or benign.
- Use **Scikit-learn** for building the model and evaluating performance.

### 3. Car Price Prediction
This project builds a regression model to predict the price of a used car based on its features, such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, and other attributes. The dataset is processed and a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) is trained to predict car prices.

#### Features:
- Predict used car prices based on input features.
- Build a regression model using **Scikit-learn**.
- Use data preprocessing techniques for better model performance.

### 4. Connector Game (CSS-based)
A simple, interactive game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game involves connecting dots to form shapes and is a fun way to learn basic web development and game logic.

#### Features:
- User interface built with CSS and JavaScript.
- Interactive gameplay with real-time feedback.
- Simple design, easy to understand.

### 5. Diabetes Predictor
This machine learning project predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on input health parameters such as age, blood pressure, BMI, and glucose levels. The model is trained using a dataset from the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**.

#### Features:
- Predict diabetes risk using health parameters.
- Use classification models like **Logistic Regression** or **Random Forest**.
- Evaluate model performance using **accuracy** and **ROC curve**.

### 6. IPL Win Guesser
This fun project uses historical IPL match data and applies machine learning to guess the winning team of a particular IPL match based on certain parameters, such as toss winner, home/away team, and team performance.

#### Features:
- Predict the winner of IPL matches based on past data.
- Interactive input for guessing the outcome.
- Built using Python and machine learning libraries.

### 7. Netflix Clone
This project replicates the **Netflix** user interface using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app includes features like browsing movies, searching for content, and displaying details for each movie/TV show.

#### Features:
- User interface similar to **Netflix**.
- Browse, search, and view movie/TV details.
- Built using front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

### 8. Simple Calculator
A basic calculator built using **Python** that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The project focuses on building a simple GUI with **Tkinter**.

#### Features:
- Perform basic arithmetic operations.
- Simple, user-friendly GUI built with **Tkinter**.
- Easy to understand code for beginners.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
  - **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models.
  - **Tkinter** for GUI development.
  - **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** for web-based projects (e.g., Connector Game, Netflix Clone).
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for experiments and model testing.

## Purpose
These projects were developed during my **Python** and **AI/ML** internships at **System Tron**. The goal of these projects was to:
- Apply machine learning algorithms to real-world datasets (e.g., car prices, cancer detection, diabetes prediction).
- Build fun and interactive web-based applications (e.g., games and clones) to showcase my web development skills.
- Work with **Python** and **AI/ML** tools to gain hands-on experience in building and deploying machine learning models.
